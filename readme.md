In this repo, I have created some end points using node and express and then created test suites for those end points with <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a><br><br>
Steps to run this repo locally:-><br>
	-> If node is not installed then install it.<br>
	-> run `npm install` to install all the node_modules.<br>
	-> run `npm run test`.<br><br>
To See all the Test Suites that, I have created goto `test/unit` for unit tests and `test\integration` for integration tests.<br> 
To get the code coverage report goto `coverage/lcov-report` and open `index.html` in your browser.<br>
